A course project in AME 598 Media Synthesis

Overview:

Last summer, I travelled around the U.S. myself. I took amtrak trains, greyhound buses, subways, and also walked around. One question that I've been often thinking about is , what is the best way to feel the world you've explored? In my opinion, every scene has a specific speed to see. At a perfect speed, you think more, you feel more, and you memorize more.
I also completed some documentations to log my trip.
1. Use Google Latitude in my iPad2 to track where Iâ€˜ve been to.
2. Use Evernote and my notebook to write up what I was thinking about.
3. Use Camera to capture what I've seen.

I just wanted to tag my text and image data with geo locations, to see if there are any interesting connection between the speed and memory.

Data Collection
Google Latitude API to export GPS data to KML file.
Manually get features from the logs: time, no. of words.
Use exiftool to export camera exif data to *.txt file.

Data Analysis
Get GPS locations with timestamps from Google Latitude Data.
Map the created time of logs and pictures to the corresponding timestamps in GPS location data.
Map the GPS locations to the major cities GPS locations.
